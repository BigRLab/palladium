User's Guide
------------

This part of the documentation is mostly prose.  It starts with
installation instructions for setting up Palladium for development, then
develops a simple pipeline for predicting classes in `the Iris flower
dataset <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set>`_ dataset.
It will explain the concepts behind Palladium as it develops the
application.
